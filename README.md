# Go Tang

> Cache Rules Everything Around Me

Go Tang is a dead simple golang + redis cache implementation that prevents the dog pile effect. Inspired by [this blog post](http://kovyrin.net/2008/03/10/dog-pile-effect-and-how-to-avoid-it-with-ruby-on-rails-memcache-client-patch/) and the Rails caching layer.
